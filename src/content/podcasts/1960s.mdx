## The Decade That Changed Everything - Not the Hits, But the Decisions

The 1960s didn't just sound different. **They changed what music was allowed to be.**

In this 71-minute conversation, Daniel and Annabelle go beyond the familiar hits. They explore the real decisions artists made under pressure - from studio experiments to genre-breaking risks.

## What You'll Discover

**You'll learn:**

- How artists went from _performing_ songs to _writing_ them
- Why the British Invasion transformed American music instead of replacing it
- How women used control systems to reshape pop music
- The moment the studio became an instrument

**You'll explore:**

- **Soul** - Aretha Franklin claiming vocal authority, Otis Redding turning strain into sound
- **Folk** - Bob Dylan and Joan Baez teaching audiences to listen closely
- **The British Invasion** - The Beatles and Rolling Stones reflecting America back to itself
- **Studio Revolution** - Brian Wilson making recording itself a form of composition
- **Psychedelia** - Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin where freedom met fragility

The 1960s opened, stretched, and tested every limit.

## The Real Story

This isn't a greatest hits collection.

It's a journey through the decisions, limits, risks, and emotional costs of growth.

- Early soul and precise pop laid the groundwork
- Girl groups like The Shirelles and The Supremes changed how women could lead
- Carole King redefined what it meant to be an author in pop
- The late 60s brought heaviness and fracture - The Doors, Sly and the Family Stone

**The 1960s left behind permission, not perfection.**

## Your Hosts

**Daniel** - Listens for structure, endurance, and the quiet decisions that turn survival into sound.

**Annabelle** - Hears soul as lived experience, emotional intelligence, and long memory carried by voice.

Together, they explore how artists grew in public - and why that still shapes how we listen today.
