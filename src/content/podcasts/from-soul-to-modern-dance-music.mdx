## How Did Soul Become House? The Beat Never Disappeared - It Evolved

From gospel to club to streaming algorithms.

**Rhythm didn't disappear. It evolved.**

In this 89-minute journey, Daniel and Annabelle trace the lineage from Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin through James Brown, Donna Summer, Chic and Sylvester - into Frankie Knuckles' Chicago house movement - and forward to Daft Punk, Beyoncé, and today's global dance culture.

## What You'll Discover

**You'll learn:**

- How church breath became dance floor percussion
- Why disco was community resistance, not just hedonism
- How Chicago house learned from gospel, not disco
- Why modern dance music is still rooted in soul's emotional architecture

**You'll explore:**

- **Gospel Roots** - Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin turning spiritual urgency into secular groove
- **Funk Architecture** - James Brown, Donna Summer, Chic, Sylvester making rhythm structural, not decorative
- **Church to Club** - The rhythm shifted from sacred spaces to secular ones - but the intensity stayed
- **Chicago House** - Frankie Knuckles adapting disco's repetition to create something new, building community
- **Electronic Evolution** - Daft Punk, Aphex Twin, James Blake keeping the soul DNA while changing the tools
- **Modern Dance Culture** - Beyoncé, Dua Lipa, The Weeknd making dance music for headphones, not just clubs

## The Real Story

This is not a lecture.

**It's a conversation about groove, endurance, resistance, and the architecture of repetition.**

From church breath to drum machines. From vinyl crates to streaming algorithms.

The pulse never disappeared - it evolved.

**Listen closely. It's still there.**
