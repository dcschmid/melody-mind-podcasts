## Latin Music Didn't Ask for Permission - It Kept Growing

Latin music didn't suddenly become global. **It moved. It adapted. It survived.**

In this 64-minute conversation, Daniel and Annabelle trace how Afro-Caribbean son traditions became salsa, exploded into global Latin pop, went underground as reggaeton, and evolved into the introspective sound of Latin trap.

## What You'll Discover
