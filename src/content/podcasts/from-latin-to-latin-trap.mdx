## The History of Hip Hop

Latin music did not suddenly become very popular.
It moved. It adapted. It survived.

In this episode of Melody Mind, Daniel and Annabelle explore how Afro-Caribbean son traditions changed into salsa, how Latin pop became popular worldwide, how reggaeton started as an underground movement, and how Latin trap has an introspective sound.

But this is not a timeline episode.

This is about pressure.
This is about migration.
This is about who was allowed on stage and who had to build their own.

We start with Arsenio Rodríguez, who changed the Cuban son structure, and then move on to the sound of New York's Cuban community through Machito and Tito Puente.

We honor the authority and endurance of Celia Cruz, whose exile made her voice more prominent around the world.

From there, salsa becomes a way of life — carried by artists like Héctor Lavoe, Willie Colón, and Rubén Blades. These musicians turned rhythm into storytelling and pride into a way of life.

We explore the crossover era with Gloria Estefan, Selena, Ricky Martin, and Shakira. These are artists who navigated language, media pressure, and global visibility without fully surrendering their roots.

Then we go back to the underground.

We trace reggaeton's rise from censored mixtapes to global popularity through artists like Daddy Yankee, Ivy Queen, and Tego Calderón. These artists gained credibility despite facing censorship and skepticism.

Now, we're in a new era where streaming is huge, and Latin trap is being influenced by artists like Bad Bunny, Karol G, Anuel AA, and Rosalía. These musicians are changing what it means to be masculine, showing vulnerability, and representing different parts of the world.

This episode is about rhythm as inheritance.
This is about survival and soundness.
It's about how Latin music didn't ask for permission and just kept growing.
